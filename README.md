sm130
=====

This SM130 Arduino Library makes it easy to use the SM130 RFID Reader. It encapsulates all the UART packet writing into simple
function calls. 

2 Warnings:
* For some reason it's very slow with reporting tags. I'll look into that soon.
* It only reads 4 bytes of the 7 byte RFID cards.
